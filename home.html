        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Greetings, I'm Christian Dominique F. Bautista, currently calling Lancaster New City in Barangay Navarro,
            General Trias, Cavite, my home. I'm presently immersed in my 3rd year pursuing a Bachelor of Science in
            Computer Science, unraveling the intricate threads of technology.

            My interests lie in the realms of gaming, 3D modeling, and programming, where every challenge sparks a new
            wave of enthusiasm. Looking ahead, my goal is to graduate, secure a stable job, and continue delving into my
            passion through advanced education.

            Being a quick learner with a strategic approach to problem-solving, I thrive in diverse environments. I
            embody the belief that determined effort, combined with adaptability, can overcome any obstacle. In my
            pursuit of aspirations, I hold onto a guiding principle: "If I desire something, I commit to achieving it,
            always mindful of ethical boundaries and rules."

            As I carve my path, I stand firm in my commitment to growth and achievement. Here's to embracing challenges,
            strategically navigating the future, and aligning passion seamlessly with a fulfilling professional journey.
        </p>
